(This is what the question means by \"capture keystroke\".)<br>- It's the first computing architecture because back then companies can't afford to give every employee a computer. So each gets a \"dumb terminal\", all connected to just one computer.<br>- While less common today, they’re still important, especially where systems process a huge amount of transactions or require a huge amount of security."
