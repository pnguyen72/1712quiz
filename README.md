# COMP-1712 Practice Quiz

Run `index.html` with vscode's Live Preview.

Compared to Learning Hub's version:

Pros:

- Faster because everything is local.
- You can combine multiple modules into one quiz.
- You can choose how many questions per attempt.

Cons:

- May be buggy (I tried my best 😓).
- By using this app you agree to wear a Hawaiian shirt to the exam (see LICENSE).
